# Visualizing Italian gender pay gap

This map of Italy shows the geographic distribution of the hourly (gross) wage and gender gap. Gender gap is calculated here as the difference between the median wage per hour for male and female. The combination of low/medium/high wage and low/medium/high gender gap defines 9 categories visualized with a bivariate colormap. The pattern of colours reveals the disparity of median wage between Northern, Central and Southern Italy, with a gradient of decreasing wages from North to South. A similar trend emerges for the gender gap distribution, which appears to be higher in richer regions and lower in poorer ones. Interestingly, a few notable exceptions to these trends are represented by some provinces on the coast such as Rimini (Wage/Hour: 10,8 €, Gap: 0,38 €), Chieti (Wage/Hour: 11,01 €, Gap: 1,38 €), Palermo (Wage/Hour: 10,94 €, Gap: 0,59 €) and Cagliari (Wage/Hour: 10,96 €, Gap: 0,57€).
